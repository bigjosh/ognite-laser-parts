### Contents

The `parts` directory contains the individual design files for each part (i.e. box cover, box drawer, etc.). 

The `final` directory contains ready-to-cut sheets, including multi-unit production panels.

### How to cut

I use a 40 watt Full Spectrum laser cutter with the following settings...

|Color|What|
|-|-|
|Red|Holes that LED leads go though|
|Blue|Markings|
|Yellow|SCoring for fold lines|
|Green|Outline cut|
|Magenta|Final panel cut|

### Material
